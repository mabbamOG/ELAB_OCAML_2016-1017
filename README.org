* giaco.ml
giaco.ml is an imperative (but also functional) interpreter written in OCAML
with no interest for speed.


The interpreter is capable of handling expressions, commands and declarations
all within a program.

The program can be parsed into valid code from a file/string thanks to the
reflection.

Perl-like taint analysis can be performed, albeit it has not been tested
thoroughly.

- NOTE :: some guards have been added to taint analysis to prove
  semi-automatic protection is possible, just like in perl. The restricted
  commands are Reflect and Lambda (actually an expression)

have fun :)
